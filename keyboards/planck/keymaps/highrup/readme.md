# Generated Keymap Layout

This layout was generated by the QMK API. You can find the JSON data used to
generate this keymap in the file layers.json.

To make use of this file you will need follow the following steps:

* Download or Clone QMK Firmware: <https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/>
* Extract QMK Firmware to a location on your hard drive
* Copy this folder into %s
* You are now ready to compile or use your keymap with the source


# Flashing your layout from mysys

cd C:\qmk_firmware

make planck/ez:highrup

More information can be found in the QMK docs: <https://docs.qmk.fm>


# Pushing your keymap to github


# Building your layout from source

Congratulations on taking the next step, and making use of your keyboard's open-source nature! There's so much power to unlock — this is going to be fun. :)

Here are some initial pointers to get you started:

- Use the documentation at [https://docs.qmk.fm/](https://docs.qmk.fm/) to set up your environment for building your firmware.
- Build your layout against [https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware/](https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware/) which is our QMK fork (instead of qmk/qmk_firmware). This is what Oryx (the graphical configurator) uses, so it's guaranteed to work.
- Create a folder with a simple name (no spaces!) for your layout inside the qmk_firmware/keyboards/planck/keymaps/ folder.
- Copy the contents of the \*\_source folder (in the .zip you downloaded from Oryx) into this folder.
- Make sure you've set up your environment per the [QMK docs](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started?id=set-up-your-environment) so compilation would actually work.
- From your shell, make sure your working directory is qmk*firmware, then enter the command `make planck/ez:_layout_`, substituting the name of the folder you created for "_layout_".

Good luck on your journey! And remember, if you get stuck, you can always get back to your [original layout](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/Jay49/KrXL7/0) from Oryx.
